We have two bugs in this game: 
1) Whenever the space key is pressed, there are multiple trajectories of the bird on the screen.
 2) The bird swings rapidly when it is reset. This is not desired. 

How is the position of the Bird stored? 
All the positions in the bird are stored in the array property called a trajectory. In order to avoid multiple trajectories, we need to clear the array. 
 
How will you empty the array whenever the space key is pressed? 
 
There are many ways to empty an array but a fast approach is by assigning no value inside empty brackets. arr=[]; 

So the old trajectory seems to get removed when the bird resets.

The second bug you need to resolve is to stop the bird swinging widely while still being attached to the slingshot. 
 
 Let's assume that each time when the bird destroys the pig, the score will increase by 50.  
 The score should keep increasing for each frame after the pig is hit till a certain score. 
 
 Let's go through the condition again. 
 
The score keeps increasing as the condition is always true as the pig is removed from the world. 
 We can add one more ‘if condition’ and change this ‘remove’ value as ‘false’ as soon as the score is updated.
